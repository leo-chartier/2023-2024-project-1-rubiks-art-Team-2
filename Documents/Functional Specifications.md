## Overview

ALGOSUP is looking for someone to produce a 60-100 square feet (5.57-9.29 square meter) fresco entirely made of Rubik’s cubes.  
The fresco will be a permanent feature of the school, displayed in what is currently the library and visible from the outside.

Each cube is to be treated as a 3x3 pixel matrix with each panel being a pixel of either green, yellow, red, orange, blue or white color.  
The library may have to be rearranged or moved in order to make the fresco more visible.

## Scope

The main objective is to create a fresco that is both accepted by ALGOSUP and eye-pleasing.

## Risks and assumptions

## Personas and use cases

Yves: Citizen of Vierzon who often passes by the "rue de la société française". He is 56 years old and has 2 children (a 17 years old daughter and a 15 years old son). He doesn't know any school in the city.  
<!-- TODO: Reformulate
If he sees the fresco everyday, he will see ALGOSUP's name and one day he will be curious and search for informations about it. He will talk about the school to his sons and maybe one of them will either talk to their friends about the school or even join ALGOSUP.
-->

## Evaluation criteria

The fresco will be evaluated based on some criteria:
- The overall fresco should not contain more than 3000 cube and no less than 2000 cube.
- The Fresco must be of rectangular form.
- The B3 (school's building) must be evoqued on the fresco.
- The fresco must include ALGOSUP’s logo
- If text is used, it must be in English
- The cubes must not be disassembled and must be rotated into position

Additionally, recording of the construction must be provided in the form of a video or timelapse for the school's social media.
