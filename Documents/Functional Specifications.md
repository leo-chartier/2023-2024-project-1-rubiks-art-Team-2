## Overview

ALGOSUP is looking for someone to produce a 60-100 square feet fresco entirely made of Rubik’s cubes. 
Each cube is to be treated as a 3x3 pixel matrix with each facet being a pixel of either green, yellow, red, 
orange, blue or white color. 
The fresco will be a permanent feature of the school, displayed in what is currently the library and visible 
from the outside. The library may have to be rearranged or moved in order to make the fresco more 
visible.

## Objectives

The main objective is to create a fresco that is both accepted by ALGOSUP and eye-pleasing.

## Personas

Yves: he is a Vierzon citizen who often pass by the "rue de la société française". He is 56 years old and has 2 children (a girl of 17 years old and a boy of 15 years old). He doesn't know any school in the city. <br>
If he sees the fresco everyday, he will see ALGOSUP's name and one day he will be curious and search for informations about it. He will talk about the school to his sons and maybe one of them will either talk to their friends about the school or even join ALGOSUP.

5. A line that accurately describes the school is must be in the fresco.
6. An image of the B3 must be on the fresco.
