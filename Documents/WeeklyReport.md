# Subject: Weekly Report - Week 3

---

## Summary:

This week marked a pivotal point in the Rubik's Art Fresco project. Unfortunately, our design was not selected by the client, and the fresco chosen was from Group 3. However, our collaboration did not end there. Group 3 requested us to pick one slice of the fresco, we opted for the 6th slice. This particular slice is further divided into 33 smaller sections.

## Accomplishments: 

1. **Fresco Selection:**
   - The client selected the fresco design presented by Group 3.

2. **Slice Selection - Slice 6:**
   - After evaluating all available slices, we decided to work on the 6th slice of the fresco due to the complexity of this slice. One of our members is comfortable with solving rubicks cube.

3. **Division into Chunks:**
   - The 6th slice was further divided into 33 smaller chunks to facilitate manageable work portions.

4. **Construction of Slice 6:**
   - Our team has constructed the 6th slice of the fresco.

5. **Chunk Verification by Team 3:**
   - Team 3 conducted a thorough verification of the 33 chunks. 
  
**Challenges:**

1. **Adaptation to New Design:**
   - Shifting from our original design to Group 3's fresco required a period of adaptation for the team.

2. **Coordination with Team 3:**
   - Ensuring seamless collaboration with Team 3 was a challenge, but effective communication and coordination strategies were established.

## Next Steps:

1. **Communication with Group 3:**
   - Ongoing communication with Group 3 will be maintained to address any questions or concerns that may arise during the construction process.

2. **Oral Preparation**
   - Our team will prepare for the oral presentation scheduled for Week 5.


## Conclusion:

Despite the shift in design selection, our team remains committed to delivering a high-quality of product. The construction and the collaboration with Team 3 have positioned us well for success in the upcoming weeks.
